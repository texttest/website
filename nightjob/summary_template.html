        The above table shows the current status of the self-tests. Currently all the TextTest tests are run every night using GTK+ 2.12 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and also on Windows XP. An additional run of the basic GUI tests is made using GTK+ 2.10 on RHEL5, which is the default version you get with RHEL5.

        Naturally we make every effort to ensure that these are always green, but there are currently a small number that contain race conditions and fail about one time in ten. By following the links above, you can check in the nightjob history to see how frequently a test has failed in the past and hence how indeterministic it is.

        Additionally, we also measure code coverage on these tests. As well as the public tests for TextTest whose results are listed there are about 200 private tests that make use of domain-specific configuration modules, and we also measure coverage of the core modules with these tests included, which is of course generally a bit higher. This allows you to tell the difference between untested code and code which can't be tested outside Jeppesen. (Jeppesen fund development of TextTest if you hadn't gathered...)
