     We feel that the world still produces way too much software that is frankly substandard. 
     The reasons for this are pretty simple: software producers do not pay enough
     attention to testing, or rely too heavily on manual testing. Manual testing 
     should be focussed on examining the user experience and finding complex bugs, 
     and too often it is used for simple regression testing : to check that the 
     latest release does not crash on startup.

     We are warm adherents of agile development practices, and practitioners of Extreme Programming. 
     We believe that the Agile movement has improved the software quality situation a great deal, 
     by moving testing to the centre of the development process and making developers 
     directly responsible for verifying the quality of their code.
     Since 2000 we have been exploring different ways of creating high-level tests that 
     communicate intent and can be understood and created by non-technical customers (Acceptance Tests). 
     The front end and common factor is a tool called TextTest.
