<div class="Text_Description">to drive a GUI or web application</div>
					<div class="Text_Normal">We are of the opinion that acceptance tests should model the
					actions of a real user of the system as closely as possible.
					Where there is a user interface (custom or web), it should be
					present for the tests too in order to catch as many bugs as
					possible, not bypassed as is common in many API-driven
					approaches. 
					</div>
					<div class="Text_Normal">Recording a test 'live' by using the system under test in
					some way is a simple and fast way to create such tests. It is,
					however, a terrible way to maintain tests &ndash; constantly
					re-recording a test is error-prone, frustrating and very
					time-consuming once you have a few tests. We aim, therefore, to
					provide an agile version of record/playback which records a
					high-level script in the language of the domain. This will allow
					increased understanding, less dependence on external factors and
					easier adjustment of existing tests without resorting to
					clicking all the buttons again.</div>
					<div class="Text_Normal">Enter the use-case recorder. This concept is intended to
					indicate a recorder that can record what is <I>intended</I> when
					a user performs some action on a GUI widget. This is in contrast
					to where he clicked on the screen, what the exact type of the
					widget he used was or exactly what sequence of keys he pressed
					to enter a text string.</div>

					<div class="Text_Normal">This is achieved (in a custom GUI) by providing a
					record/playback library that can be called by the system under
					test, to associate each relevant GUI event with a 'use case
					command' which can be any text string but which should describe
					what is intended in terms of the domain - and should avoid any
					mention of how it is achieved. In 'record' mode this library can
					then simply add an extra listener to the event which will record
					the string provided in a 'use case' , as illustrated:</div>
