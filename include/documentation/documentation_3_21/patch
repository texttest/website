In general neither TextTest nor PyGTK handle paths with spaces in their names well: both are ports of software written on UNIX so you're well advised to steer clear of "Program Files" and "Documents and Settings", whatever your Windows best-practice manual may tell you...

! On the <u>Mac</u>, some hints can be found on the <A class="Text_Link" HREF="http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&file=faq01.019.htp">PyGTK FAQ</A>. Basically PyGTK doesn't build natively for the Mac so you should install Apple's Xll server. This implies installing the Developer Tools, XQuartz and then Macports, before getting PyGTK by executing "port install py26-gtk". Note that this may take quite some time to complete.

  your path though, so you'll need to set PATH in autoexec.bat or
  similar to include wherever it's installed (typcially something
  like C:\Program Files\tkdiff)</div>

+ On the Mac you can get it via Macports in a similar way to PyGTK, i.e. "port install tkdiff".

  <div class="Text_Normal"><LI><B><U>Emacs and notepad</U></B>. TextTest also makes use of a generic editor for viewing files. This defaults to "emacs" on UNIX systems and "notepad" on Windows, which are both likely to be pre-installed. Your UNIX installation will certainly have a package for "emacs" if not. It's easy to change these to use other editors if desired via the "view_program" configuration setting.</div>
