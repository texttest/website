<div class="Text_Header">Overview of the Documentation</div>

<div class="Text_Normal">You should start by working
through the <a class="Text_Link" href="index.php?page=<?php echo $version ?>&n=install_texttest">installation guide</a>, naturally. After this it is
recommended that you work through one or both of the tutorials,
this should give you a feel for basic TextTest usage. 
</div>
<div class="Text_Normal">The user guide material is a
little bit more theoretical. However, it is generally useful to
browse the first two or three documents to help gain a high
level view of how TextTest works and how to configure it. These
describe the basic details of building test suites and running
tests.</div>
<div class="Text_Normal">The User Interfaces guide is
there as a complete guide to the GUIs, which are more
configurable than you might imagine. Read it if understanding
the GUI isn't going too well...</div>
<div class="Text_Normal">The rest is mostly summaries of
additional features of TextTest. It can be worth reading just
the introduction to each of these to see if the features seems
like something that would be useful to you. Reading further is
probably only useful if they are.</div>

<div class="Text_Normal">Besides being a
standalone tool, TextTest is also a framework written in the
<A class="Text_Link"  class="Text_Link" HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python language</A>. If you are
a Python programmer (or have access to one) it is probably worth
browsing the framework documentation.</div>
