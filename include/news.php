    	Dear all,
	</div>
	<div class="Text_Normal">
		As promised TextTest 3.11 is now available for <a class="Text_Link" href="index.php?page=download">download</a>. There are lots of improvements, 
		and a few things have moved around. I paste the whole ChangeLog below, whose formatting will 
		no doubt get mangled by the sourceforge list software... As ever people upgrading should read 
		the Migration Notes in the download, also available via the Help menu in the TextTest GUI.
	</div>
	<div class="Text_Normal">	
		Let me know of any problems...

    <div class="Text_Normal">
    	As you probably noticed we have released a new version of the texttest site.
    	We have still some smaller things to fix (like the ugly background) and if you find any error or 
    	have any suggestion of how to improve the site, 
    	please do not hesitate to <a class="Text_Link" href="index.php?page=contact">contact</a> us. 
    	You will find the old site <a class="Text_Link" href="old_version/index.html">here</a>
