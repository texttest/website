<div class="Text_Normal">
Anyone using Eclipse RCP will have seen the <A class="Text_Link" HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-RCP-3/tutorial3.html">Mail template</A>. Prior to this screencast I have downloaded it, exported it as a product and installed SWTBot under it. I have also naturally installed TextTest and PyUseCase.

The screencast demonstrates how to record a basic test for this application with little fuss and no test code. Note how we choose a "domain language" to describe what we do, providing the test with additional readability and durability. Note also how an ASCII log describing what we see on the screen is generated when we replay, which serves as a measure of the behaviour of the system. The test will in future warn us if this behaviour changes at all.
