   <div class="Text_Normal">
     Due to over 1000 automated acceptance tests for itself, written in itself, the contents of source control
     are almost always quite usable. Anyone wishing to make changes should obviously get hold of this version also.
     The code is hosted on Launchpad and can be browsed online <a class="Text_Link" href="https://code.launchpad.net/~geoff.bache/texttest/trunk">here</A>. </div>
<div class="Text_Normal">
  To get hold of the latest version, you will need to install the <a class="Text_Link" href="http://bazaar-vcs.org">Bazaar version control tool</A>. You can then just do "bzr checkout lp:texttest" to get the latest code. In order to run it, you will also need the latest version of PyUseCase, which you can get by doing "bzr checkout lp:pyusecase" and then running "python setup.py install" in the checked out location.</A></div>
<div class="Text_Normal">
If you wish to make changes you should get the latest version of the self-tests also, this is done via "bzr checkout lp:/~geoff.bache/texttest/selftest-trunk". You should run your changes against these tests and add new tests if you add new functionality. The source for this website can also be retrieved from "lp:~geoff.bache/texttest/website-trunk" if you find errors in the documentation.
